## 📑 Intro 🔝
It is a truth universally acknowledged, at least among med students, that creating flashcards consumes time. And so, with the advent of AI, it became possible to delegate such a task to a semantically intellegent machine. This however, posed new problems, namely; the price of services, model hallucinations, and the fact that turning your entire lecture sheet into flashcards generates a lot of redundancy.

**Price** ClipyCards solves the problem of price by allowing you to use your own API key, currently OpenAI's. You can turn the entire Harry Potter series into falshcards (yes, including the last book) with GPT3.5 at $2, or the new 4o-mini at $0.75. You can also use beefier models like GPT4. Oh, and APIs are a per-use charge, not a monthly subscriptions.

**Hallucinations** ClipyCards uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG), meaning that it keeps the context of your study session and generates cards from and around that context. When you copy a chunk of text, the app feeds this text, along with relevant context from its temporary study session database, into GPT and then retrieves the generated card with its prompt (incase you want to regenerate or modify the prompt).

**Redundancy** You can just copy your entire lecture sheet, or copy the parts that needs remembering, thus generating specific cards.
